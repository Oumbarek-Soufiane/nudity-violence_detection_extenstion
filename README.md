# Real Time Nudity & Violence Detection

This project is a Chrome Extension designed to protect teenagers by detecting and filtering nudity and violence in real-time while browsing the web. It utilizes the **Gemini 3 Flash Preview API** for high-speed, accurate image analysis.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **frontend/**: The React application for the extension UI (popup) and the content scripts.
* **backend/**: The Node.js server that acts as a secure bridge to handle API requests to Gemini.

## 🛠️ Running and Building

### Development Mode (Browser View)
Runs the app in the development mode.
```bash
cd frontend
npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the popup UI in your browser.

### Build for Chrome (Required for Extension)
To compile the React code into static files that Chrome can understand as an extension:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build

This command creates a build folder inside frontend/. This folder contains the final extension files.

📦 How to Load in Chrome
Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.

Toggle Developer mode (top right corner) to ON.

Click the Load unpacked button.

Select the frontend/build folder you just created (do not select the public or src folder).

The extension (with your custom Shield Icon) should now appear in your toolbar!

🔑 Environment Variables
To make the detection work, you need a valid Gemini API key.

Create a file named .env inside the backend/ directory.

Add your API Key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
PORT=3001
